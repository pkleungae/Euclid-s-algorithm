# Euclid-s-algorithm

Recently I have been using recurive approach for lot of cases. 
After rethinking much of recursive approach, I would like to try to rewrite the elegant solution of Euclid-s-algorithm, which I found simple but not intuitive in the past, to see if I can come up the same with ease.  
It turned out that it is really simple once I accmulated enough thoughts of mode of recursive thinking.
